# my-first-express-server
The first server I created using Express.JS with Node.JS. This was a task part of Angela Yu's "Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp"

The node_modules file can not be added on github because of its size, and therefore this project can not be deployed on github. 

If you would like to open this project, you need to: 
1) Install node and npm on your computer, if you don't have it already. 
2) Download the code
3) Navigate to the folder on terminal
4) Type "npm install" to install all project dependencies
5) Type "npm install -g nodemon" to install all project dependencies. 
6) Then "nodemon server.js" to get the server running on a local host.
